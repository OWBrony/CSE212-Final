Your mother is making pancakes as you wait.
She puts some on the nearby plate and, in turn,
you take some.

At some point you decide to count how many are on the plate.
After that, your mother stops cooking and takes some pancakes
for her self.
You check to see if there are any more and find none.

## 1. Print the stack:
* finish the function to
print each item in the stack.

## 2. Remove from the stack:
* You need to remove from the back of the
stack as if you are popping a pancake off the
top of the stack.

## 3. Check the size:
* Finish the function for checking the length
of the stack.
* This will be the same as checking the length
of a list.

## 4. Check if empty:
* Finish the function for checking if the stack
is empty.
* Return True if the stack is empty
* Return False if not.
