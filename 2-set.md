* You and your D&D party are trying to solve a puzzle.

* The puzzle involves a series of numbers on four dials.
* most of the numbers look the same, but there are a few differences.

* You reason that the numbers that don't appear on the
* other dials are the key to the puzzle.

* Your job is to find the differences between each of the four
* dials using sets.

## 1. Find the odd one out:
* Check each set against the others.
* For each item that is not in the others,
put it in a set dedicated to those
numbers.
* Return the set so it can be viewed by you.
